ERODE is tool to analyse various types of models using a special language format developed for this purpose. SBML is a widely used XML-based format that can represent a vast amount of different biological models. The aim of this project is to develop a converter between ERODE and SBML-qual, an SBML-extension used to represent the model types that are supported by ERODE. To develop such a converter, the project begins with an analysis of both formats and the conversion requirement. The obtained knowledge is then used to design and implement the converter. During the entire development process, the project is being tested extensively to ensure a correct conversion.
